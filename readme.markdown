FestUtilitiesAndroid
====================

Just  a quick mini-fork/port of   Nic Strong's FestUtils and FestAssertionsAndroid(which are post of FestUtils and Fest)
so I could build it and use th jars in android projects as I do not use Maven. All credit goes to Nic Storng who owas the original coder that 
ported this to Android.

The Two projects are:
[FestUtilitiesAndroid](https://github.com/shareme/FestUtilitiesAndroid)
[FestAssertionsForAndroid](https://github.com/shareme/FestAssertionsForAndroid)

You need to use boht jars in your Androdi instrumented Test Project.

Current Version
===============

Current version is built aginst Androdi SDK version 15, ie 4.0.x. I built the jars by just doing comiled jar export
making sure to delete the android.jar it includes as alib to prevent conflicts.
